#pm-client
React Client for Church Membership Database (Peri Meleon)

#Overview
This is a very early prototype of a client UI for PM-Web. It provides some viewing capabilities which illustrate the ability of react-table to render, filter, sort, and group data records. It does not provide any capabilities for modifying data.

#Pre-Requesite
Install [pm_http_server](https://github.com/fkuhl/pm_http_server), populate it with data, and run the server on port 8000.
